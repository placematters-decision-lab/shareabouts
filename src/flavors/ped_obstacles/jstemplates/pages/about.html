<h1>About Walk Philly</h1>

<p>Walkability is a key component to a great city. <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/walkable-neighborhoods.shtml">Research</a> shows that high walkability translates into healthier, wealthier, cleaner, and more connected communities.</p>

<p>Philadelphia is already considered one of the <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/PA/Philadelphia">most walkable cities in the country</a>, but our great pedestrian access is spotty and not available to all citizens.</p>

<p>This map gives Philadelphians a way of recording and sharing pedestrian obstacles like broken or missing <a href="http://streetswiki.wikispaces.com/Sidewalks">sidewalks</a>, lack of <a href="http://streetswiki.wikispaces.com/Pedestrian+Signal">crossing signals</a>, or an overabundance of <a href="http://streetswiki.wikispaces.com/Parking%2C+Off+Street">off street parking</a> in our communities. By making this information publicly available, we can illustrate areas of greatest need and build support for improvements.</p>

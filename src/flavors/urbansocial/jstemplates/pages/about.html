<h1>About</h1>

<p>Kendall Innovation is a group of urban planners, architects and researchers.  We are studying where people connect in cities and how cities might foster social connections (and potentially collaboration and innovation). Right now, we're focusing on the Kendall Square area in Cambridge, MA.</p>

<p>Located near MIT and anchored by one subway station, Kendall Square is considered the premier location for Biotech and IT innovation in New England. By identifying the patterns of interaction in an innovation cluster like this, we intend to deepen the understanding of the use of physical space in centers of innovation.</p>

<p>This map will provide a new way to collect data about where people typically congregate, what types of interactions they have in a given space, and where ideas are generated. Knowing the role of space in interaction can guide future design to encourage productivity. </p>

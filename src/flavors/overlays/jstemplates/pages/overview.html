<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello! You're looking at a demo of Shareabouts, a mapping project from <a
  href="http://openplans.org/civicworks">OpenPlans</a>.</p>

<p>Shareabouts is a simple web app for crowdsourced mapping. You can use it to
  collect public input on maps - for example, where should a new park be built?
  Which bus stops need a new shelter? People can put dots on the map, add
  comments, discuss other people's suggestions and share locations over social
  networks.</p>

<p>Shareabouts uses <a href="http://openplans.github.com/argo">Argo</a> to 
  allow you to add layers to your map. You can add additional overlays on top 
  of your base layer. To do so, add to the "layers" array in your flavor 
  <a href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/blob/master/doc/CONFIG.md">
  configuration file</a>. This array should match the configuration format 
  for <a href="https://github.com/openplans/argo/wiki/Configuration-Guide">
  Argo</a> layer options.</p>

<p>Thanks for trying out Shareabouts!</p>

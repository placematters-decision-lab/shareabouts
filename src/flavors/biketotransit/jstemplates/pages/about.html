  href="http://www.openplans.org/">Open Plans</a> are collaborating to determine
  how transit stations can better accommodate bicyclists. This map will help
  identify where the demand for better bicycle facilities is greatest.</p>

<p>Between September 21st and December 21st, 2012, the public could click on a
  station where they would like to see improvements, and respond to the
  questions in our survey. They could choose a station they bike to, or one they
  would bike to if improvements were made. Click the stations to see the input
  that we collected.</p>

<p>OpenPlans developed this map using its Shareabouts software, which is a tool
  to crowdsource data in a neighborhood or city. If you have any questions or
  comments, please contact us at <a

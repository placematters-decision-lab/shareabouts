<h1>About Walkshops</h1>

<p>Welcome! This site is to help you identify places to preserve (green dots), places to change (red dots), or general comments (brown dots).</p>

<p>At the end of this process, we will have a map that helps us better understand the area as it is today and how we'd like it to look in the future.</p>

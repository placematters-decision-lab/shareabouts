<h1>About</h1>

<p>The KROSS/walk project wants your input on locations in Downtown Brooklyn and the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us about the safe intersections that make your walking and
biking trips better, and tell us about the unsafe intersections that make your
trips worse.</strong></p>

<p>These comments will be mapped and coordinated for Community Boards, local
elected officials, our police precincts, to make positive changes and to Make
Brooklyn Safer! The maps will also be useful to help choose routes when
traveling on a new street or on the different path.</p>

<p>In trying to find a healthy and safe alternative to getting our kids around
Brooklyn, we have found that making our local trips on bike and on foot allows
for our kids to be part of the movement, literally. Brooklyn kids are on the
streets getting to and from school, activities, sports, and parks. Brooklyn kids
are meeting and greeting each other, and our streets are the places to meet, or
the place in between it all. Brooklyn kids know the rules of the road, (cars
rule!) and we would like to mix it up with your help. We all have our own routes
that work for us, and there are routes we avoid. As a community we aim to make
our streets safer by pointing out problems that concern us, as people who
ride/walk/travel with our kids. You don't have to have kids to care about their
safety. </p>

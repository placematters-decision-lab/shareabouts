<p>The Sister Cities Park Survey is a tool for collecting valuable metrics
  about park usage. It's really easy to get started.</p>

<p>
  <h4>Collect data consistently</h4>
  Consistent data collection is important to creating useful data.
  Visit the park hourly and record the current usage of each section of the
  park at that moment. This will give you usage data (how many) that is also
  spatial (where) and temporal (when).

  <h4>Download and explore your data</h4>
  At any time you can click Download Data link to get a CSV file (a
  spreadsheet) of your data. Use this information to answer interesting
  questions like:
  <ul>
    <li>What day of the week is most popular?</li>
    <li>What section of the park is most underutilized?</li>
    <li>What is the average usage of each section?</li>
  </ul>

  The answers to these questions and more can provide you with useful insights
  to make improvements and expand successes for a better park for everyone.

<h1>About</h1>

<p><a href="http://udstudio.org" target="_blank">The University of Louisville's
Urban Design Studio</a> and the non-profit <a
href="http://citycollaborative.org/" target="_blank">City Collaborative</a> are
passionate about Louisville's historic structures and spaces. We believe that
our city's cultural and economic success in recent years has been greatly
bolstered by our large concentrations of architectural treasures.</p>

<p><strong>Add historic buildings, places and heritage resources in Louisville.
Share a personal memory about why this site is important to you.</strong></p>

<p>For over 40 years the historic preservation movement in Louisville has helped
create a city with a unique flavor that is increasingly being recognized as an
important cultural center and as a place with a high quality of life thanks to
our historic urban neighborhoods.</p>

<p>As a city, we will use this mapping application to identify buildings,
places, and heritage resources in Louisville that the community values as
historic and worth saving and in the process initiating a necessary discussion
about preservation.</p>

<p>The hope is that we can thoughtfully engage a large portion of Louisvillians
by using this mapping application to identify the buildings, places, and spaces
in Louisville that its community members value as historic and worthy of preservation.</p>

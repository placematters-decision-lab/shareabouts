<h5 class="tips">Pedestrian Count</h5>
<p class="tips">Is it raining or snowing?</p>

<h5 class="tips">Sidewalk Quality</h5>
<p class="tips">What type of sidewalk?</p>
<span class="tips">Use your best guess for sidewalk width. Sometimes in Denver, we see narrow sidewalks with curbs that are designed for cars to drive onto for parking. For these, choose "no curb". Detached sidewalks have a strip of grass or other space between the sidewalk and the road, like this:</span>

<p class="tips">Are there obstructions in the sidewalk?</p>
<span class="tips">Anything that would prevent pedestrians from easily using the sidewalk is an obstruction. Examples might include trash or debris, overgrown plants, or utility poles. While you're at it, go ahead and tell us what the obstruction is in the Description!
</span>
<p class="tips">Is the sidewalk significantly cracked or uneven?</p>
<span class="tips">A crack or uneven sidewalk is significant if it makes it unsafe or difficult for pedestrians. Ignore minor cracks or other abnormalities that don't affect sidewalk usage.</span>
<p class="tips">Do you feel unsafe? (lighting, traffic, or other)</p>
<span class="tips">Safety is important, but often hard to quantify. Sometimes low lighting or fast-moving traffic can trigger of safety concerns, while other times the presence of lots of people or appropriate protection from traffic can offset those concerns. Use your best judgement and tell us more in the Description!   </span>
<h5 class="tips">Intersection Quality</h5>
<p class="tips">How many lanes are there to cross?</p>
<span class="tips"> Count the number of lanes on the street with the <strong>most</strong> lanes. For instance, if one street had 4 lanes and the other had 7, the number of lanes recorded would be 7. You should also count turn lanes as lanes.</span>
<p class="tips">Are there median islands or bulb-outs?</p>
